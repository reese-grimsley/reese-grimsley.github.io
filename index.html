										<h2>Reese Grimsley</h2>

									</header>
									<p>I am a second year student PhD student at Carngie Mellon University, studying Electrical and Computer Engineering. I am co-advised by Bob Iannucci and Anthony Rowe in their respective groups, Computation and Communications Structures, and Wireless Sensing and Embedded Systems Lab (WISELab).</p>
									
									<p>My work focuses on strategies for reasoning about large-scale IoT applications,  covering domains like Smart Cities, Environmental Sensing, and Industrial Control. The goal is to make programming such broad, complex systems more approachable for a non-expert, such as a civil engineer or hydrologist, without oversimplifying the vast challenges that we face when dealing with such heterogeneous, time-sensitive, distributed systems that engage in physical interaction with the environment. </p>

									<p>My goal is to build a career in engineering large-scale sensor networks that overhaul the way we monitor and respond to events in natural environments, urban infrastructure, and industrial settings. I find the idea of broadly sensing physical phenomena from many angles, often with a great degree of redundancy, profoundly interesting, as we can generate a more holistic understanding of that phenomena without an overreliance on any one part of the system. Abstract as that sounds, I've had a chance engage in this with an ongoing relation between Dr. Bob Iannucci's group and the U.S. Geologoical Survey, with whom we have built a system for sensing watershed conditions in the tributaries to the Russian River Valley in Northern California at <a href="https://engineering.cmu.edu/news-events/news/2019/10/23-iannucci-pepperwood.html"> Pepperwood Preserve</a>, which involves LPWAN enabled stream gauge sensors for reporting real-time water stream data for the makings of an early-warning flood detection application. I am hopeful I can can bring some of these concepts to another readily impactful domain in city-scale sensing, providing sensing and control infrastructure for applications such as traffic flow control. I would love to build V2X infrastructure that narrows the gap between ever-improving autonomous vehicles, which sense their surroundings from an insulated chassis, and the traffic lights that dictate vehicle flows.  </p>

									<p> In a much broader vision, I would like to use my career to push the IoT and other Cyber Physical Systems to a more 'federated' form, in which many internet connected devices can securely and efficiently collaborate for a wide variety of applications, cooperating such that the IoT looks from the outside like a singular computing platform, rather than a hodge-podge of heterogeneous and independent computers. This is rooted in the desire to make programming the IoT tractable for the average person. We can look to the explosion of most computing platforms (most recently Cloud and Mobile Phone computing) to see that squirreling away the most difficult and boring bits away -- without oversimplifying or trivializing -- provides a massive boost to the usability of a computing paradigm. I could write paragraphs (or short novels, as I sometimes do by accident!) on why this is such a challenging problem, ranging from technical to economic to political issues. It's a big task -- one fit for a career!</p>
